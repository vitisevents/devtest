    Docker, the hottest technology around at the moment. It swept the Ops world by storm in 2014, became mainstream in 2015, and now it’s set to dominate the developer world, in 2016. Docker is a tool that allows you to package your application up into a single-runnable distributable binary - akin to the phar, but in Hulk mode. Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production. In this tutorial I will pull back the curtain and show you how Docker works and the technologies that make it all possible. We'll dive into Docker Image Layering and optimisation, Docker Networking, Docker Plugins and orchestrating containers at scale with Docker Swarm.

    Everyone must migrate to PHP 7! Take advantage of exceptional performance improvements, cut your hardware use in half and enjoy the best of PHP. This workshop is for everyone that is still eyeing PHP 7 while still using PHP 5, and wants to review their 1 million LOC project before jumping to PHP 7. When migrating, we need to check old code and target only the interesting issues. This session will connect the backward incompatibilities and new features to their actual location in the code, relying on static analysis to quickly process a large code base. Based on our accumulated experience and tools, we'll review the issues, diagnose criticality, select the best fixes and prioritize the tasks. All tools are Open Source, and ready to be integrated into your project lifecycle.

    PHP's stateless execution model is still based on the mechanics of CGI: request in, response out. This simplicity also means overhead on each request from frameworks starting up; applications also cannot interact with the request body during transmission, e.g. for streaming the body or handling upgrades to Websockets. That's why all other web languages now offer production ready web servers implemented purely in each language: Jetty, Puma, Gunicorn and friends use a modern process model and standardized middleware protocols. PHP 7 finally brought some necessary engine changes like catchable fatal errors, so there now is no longer a need for Apache or Nginx: event based HTTP components from projects like ReactPHP or Icicle, brought together by a server like Aerys or PHP-PM, start a framework once, and handle requests in a loop. The result is a massive gain in performance especially with frameworks like Symfony, and the potential for new features that previously were not possible with an external web server in front of an application. Let's explore the current state of affairs, the solutions other programming languages found, and the bright new future that's ahead for PHP, which, as always, will require sacrifices to be made.

You can scale up to deal with the excess traffic, but what do you do when your load is variable? How do you do that, and stay on budget? This session is a case study on getting an App Engine app to scale to serve 30,000,000 requests an hour.  It will take you through the architecture, the code changes and the technology trade offs to get to that level of traffic. And how to make sure your app scales down so running infrastructure to deal with potential traffic doesn't drown you.

    High availability is becoming a de-facto requirement of today's applications. Customer-facing IT failures mean directly losing customer revenue and trust, as users have grown accustomed to easily switching service providers for more reliable ones. Lack of internal systems availability block employee productivity and add to the financial burden. Thus, it is critical to have a healthy, performant, resilient IT structure serving as a backbone of conducting your business. But there are no textbook solutions to achieving five 9s availability. Data redundancy, computing clusters, load balancing, fail-over mechanisms, each of these individually addresses one potential issue, but none treats systems in your organisation holistically for maximising business revenue. Silos are a clever method of grouping servers in such a way that they can be scaled both horizontally and vertically, depending on the actual application needs. Most importantly, it frees you from over-optimizing the architecture upfront, by allowing fine adjustments easy to integrate in your Agile workflow.

    At one time or another, every developer comes across the same problem - their application starts getting slower, then starts falling over, then isn't available at all. Often, this comes down to too many users, too much stored data - in other words a scaling problem. Looking at a range of options, from horizontal and vertical scaling, to caching, sharding and optimisation, Liam will discuss approaches to scaling that can be used on new applications, and also some that can be retro-fitted to existing applications.

    Drupal8 modernization (new object-oriented base) and adoption of many Symfony components is a huge step in connecting these two amazing communities and amazing projects. Drupal8 is not powered by full-stack Symfony and there is still many differences between these two relatives, but still, Symfony developers should master it easily. This talk is for Symfony developers who don't have experience with Drupal8. It will guide you through routing, controllers, hooks, events, Drupal Console, DI and many other interesting elements that power Drupal8 under the hood. It will also show how to build custom modules Symfony way.

    So, you want to use Docker and Kubernetes for your development but don’t want to spend your days writing Dockerfiles and running Docker builds? In this talk you will learn how to deploy and manage applications using docker, kubernetes, and the open source OpenShift projects to truly simplify your development flow. Diving a bit deeper, we will learn how to use the Source 2 Image project to automatically build and deploy docker images straight from source code. After that, we will take it up a notch by learning how to add databases and scale the application to achieve fast response times for your users. At the conclusion of this talk, you will understand the workflow to build, deploy, scale and manage applications deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift. And just for giggles, we will also learn how to do A/B and Blue / Green deployments.

    Websockets are a technology allowing bi-directional communication between the server and the client and are not often the topic of focus when it comes to writing standard web applications due to their architectural complexity and learning curve required. This talk is the story of my first real project involving sending torrent data from the server to the browser so I could build my own Torrent Web GUI. What is an event loop? How does it work? How about authentication when using both HTTP and Websocket requests? How do I make my code non-blocking? These are some of the topics covered from both a theoretical and a practical standpoint. I also talk about security and privacy and how not to get caught when setting up a server designed solely for streaming Ubuntu downloads.

    Software bugs are inevitable; some are especially difficult to track down, causing you to waste countless hours before throwing your hands up in defeat. It doesn't have to be this way! The mental fatigue and wasted time can be avoided by using strategies like identifying the most-appropriate tool, taking a logical & objective approach, challenging assumptions, listening to variables, isolating the code path, and reinforcing code with automated tests. Attendees will learn how to combine these techniques with the right mindset and attitude in order to debug their code quickly and effectively.

    Decoupling, abstracting and ungluing your applications has been something that people have been talking about for years. Ultimately though, most packages still have dependencies and creating a library-abstract bundle is still hard but it's getting easier. How far are we from having the ability to package re-usable web-focussed widgets that can be composed into applications? What would a world where libraries were all non-framework specific that could be glued in look like? Lets have a look at how far we've come as an industry and what the future could hold.
